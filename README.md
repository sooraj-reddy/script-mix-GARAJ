# script-mix-GARAJ  
**Mixing Scripts for Low-resource Language Parsing**  

## Overview  
Script Mix is executed with the following pipeline:  

1. **Data loading and preprocessing.**  
2. **MBERT model** with pre-trained knowledge of major languages worldwide.  
3. **Training language adapters** with both original and transliterated scripts of a new low-resource language separately.  
4. **Fusing these two Language Adapters** using Adapter Fusion Plus.  
5. **Training a new task adapter** upon this for POS Tagging and Dependency Parsing.  

The code is available in **`script-mix-GARAJ.ipynb`**.
